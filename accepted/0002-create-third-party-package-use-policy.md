Deciders: [Nicolas Maurice](https://github.com/nicomadev) (team member)

## Context

The use of third-party packages (specifically NuGet packages) can cause some issues if they are not safe (malicious code), not properly maintained (unreliable or outdated code) or use incompatible licenses (legal issues).

## Decision

Use and enforce a strict policy on the use of third-party packages adressing the following concerns:

- Safety
- Reliability
- Licensing

## Consequences

The policy is created at <https://link-to-the-policy> and shared to the team.

## More information

The policy can evolve without needing a new ADR.
